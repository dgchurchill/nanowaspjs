<h1>About</h1>
NanoWasp is an emulator for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBee">MicroBee</a> computer.
The MicroBee was popular in Australia in the mid 1980s.
NanoWasp requires a relatively recent browser with JavaScript enabled.


<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
The Z80 CPU emulation code comes from <a href="http://matt.west.co.tt/">Matt Westcott's</a> 
<a href="http://matt.west.co.tt/spectrum/jsspeccy/">JSSpeccy</a> project, a ZX Spectrum
emulator written in JavaScript.  It was ported from the 
<a href="http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/">Fuse</a> project.
Some ideas have also been incorporated from Stewart Kay's <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ubee512">uBee512</a> emulator.
Resources and feedback from the people at both the <a href="http://www.microbee-mspp.org.au/">MicroBee Software Preservation Project</a> and the <a href="http://microbee.com.au/shell/">Bee Board</a> 
have been invaluable over the course of developing earlier versions of NanoWasp and the current JavaScript incarnation.
